        <!-- Exposition | EMPATHY -->
        <p>The Jones’ family have a two year old daughter called Grace. Charlotte and Kevin, Grace’s parents, both work full-time and are conscientious people, with a keen interest in environmental issues as well as human health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Rising action | FRUSTRATION | Time-->
        <p>Charlotte tried to grow some strawberries during the summer to teach Grace and provide her favourite fruit, however she didn’t have time to maintain them and they eventually succumbed to pests in the garden,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Rising action | SADNESS / Seasonal -->
        <p>Grace wants some strawberries. After eating them all summer, it is now October. Strawberries are not in season in the UK.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Rising action | DISAPPOINTMENT / Quality & locality -->
        <p>Kevin picks some Spanish strawberries from the supermarket on his way home from work. After checking the packs, he finds the best of the bunch which are smaller and blander than those they enjoyed in the summer. Kevin takes a keen
          interest in the environment and shudders at the thought of a truck driving food halfway across Europe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Climax | HOPE -->
        <p>Kev invests in the Ruuts Plantio single plant growing system and sets up his free online account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Falling Action | EXCITED -->
        <p>After germinating a batch of strawberry seeds in their home, Kevin, Charlotte and Grace transfer them to the Plantio system once they begin to sprout.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Falling Action | RELAXED -->
        <p>The Jones family then go on with their everyday lives, checking in on the plant daily via the app to show Grace how it is doing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c m---1">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" />
        <!-- Denouement (Conclusion) | EMPATHY -->
        <p>The Plantio system tells the family when the fruit is ready to harvest and suggests they begin to germinate a new batch of seeds ready to go straight into the system.</p>

    We took the opportunity to experience growing our own food as a family. It's been fun introducing the process to our 2 year old daughter who really enjoyed helping us start to grow our own food and has learnt about how food can be produced
    and what part nature plays in the process.

    The instructions with the kit we used were a bit vague and missed a few vital elements (such as water occasionally) but with a little bit of improvisation and nature finally taking its course, we managed to start to grow some aubergines,
    peppers and green beans.

    "It has also encouraged us to grow our own tomatoes which took about 4-5 weeks before we could use them in a home made lasagne and vegetarian pizza (the Tomatoes tasted noticeably stronger and fresher). It is taking a fair bit of time for
    the aubergines, peppers and greenbeans to grow and we will persist but perhaps a simpler solution to assist growing our own food would help make it easier for a family."

    We will certainly try some new methods in the future and are now all excited at the prospects of growing our own food, we are also happy it has caught the interest of our daughter and let us understand more about food as a family as we
    interact together.

## Appendix
{: #ref .page-break}

1. Based on a bottom up analysis. Approximately 8 million uk users fit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Age_structure">persona<a />, which equates to 4 million couples, placing one unit per
    family each with a potential unit spend of £200.
2. Approximate timeline of 6 months to MVP in December 2018, a 3 month alpha test, 6 months product development, another 3 month alpha test, 3 months product development, 3 months public beta test, and launch in Autumn 2020.
3. An initial competitor analysis reveals <a href="https://aerofarms.com/frequently-asked-questions/">high end systems</a> aimed squarely at the business and industrial markets; or <a href="https://eu.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-9">low
    end</a>, hobbyist systems utilising low-technology, poorly thought out solutions for the affluent middle class. There is a distinct gap for a highly developed, affordable consumer system.
4. No consumer system excists that utilises aeroponic nozzles, the most advanced system for controlling molecular diameters of liquids. Coupled with the latest wif-fi arduino uno board and low energy LEDs shows the concept pushing
  technology in all boundaries.
5. Results obtained from my <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/110GA-5qPCFBt9as8R2DtQPgxbPZQbwrPA91Jolwq-7g/edit#responses"> user study</a> of 54 participants.
6. Mr. Kevin Jones underwent a full growing experiment with his family, and quoted:

<blockquote><p>We took the opportunity to experience growing our own food as a family. It's been fun introducing the process to our 2 year old daughter who really enjoyed helping us start to grow our own food and has learnt about how food can be produced and what part nature plays in the process.
<br /><br />
The instructions with the kit we used were abit vague and missed a few vital elements (such as water occasionally) but with a little bit of improvisation and nature finally taking its course, we managed to start to grow some aubergines,
peppers and green beans.
<br /><br />
It has also encouraged us to grow our own tomatoes which took about 4-5 weeks before we could use them in a home made lasagne and vegetarian pizza (the Tomatoes tasted noticeably stronger and fresher). It is taking a fair bit of time for the aubergines, peppers and greenbeans to grow and we will persist but perhaps a simpler solution to assist growing our own food would help make it easier for a family.
<br /><br />
We will certainly try some new methods in the future and are now all excited at the prospects of growing our own food, we are also happy it has caught the interest of our daughter and let us understand more about food as a family as we interact together.</p></blockquote>
