<img src="/media/ruuts__tech.svg" >
### Grow perfect food, automatically.

## Product Overview

### Value Proposition

> PlantIO allows you to grow perfect food for your family all year round at a low cost to you and the environment, completely automatically.

### Summary

#### Description

PlantIO is a fully automatic growing system for plants. Controlled from pre-selected recipes, it provides for all your plants' needs until it comes to fruition, only contacting the user in the event of an emergency or when the plant is ready to be harvested. Aeroponics is used to grow the plant, negating the need for any soil and reducing the water and land usage by over 90% compared to traditional growing methods.

#### Features

The user can monitor their plant at any point using the Progressive Web Application (PWA) from any device with a web browser. The PWA communicates with the PlantIO hardware, which takes the form of a blackout growing box housing LED lights for complete control of lumen levels, an aeroponic atomiser nozzle for accurate delivery of food and thermostatically controlled heater to maintain the optimum ambient temperature.

#### Technical information

##### Software
* PWA communicating with the hardware through the johnny5 javascript library.
* 24/7 remote access from any internet enabled browser
* Cross platform, single codebase, automatically updating software
* Optional manual & semi-automatic modes enable more interactive growing

##### Hardware
* Custom built blackout enclosure extends to any plant size and ensures complete separation of light from plant roots.
* Aeroponic atomiser nozzle delivers exacting amounts of feed at the optimum atomic size to enable maximum nutrient uptake from the plants roots
* LED lighting delivers the optimum wavelength for the plant at extremely low energy consumption levels and zero heat creation.
* Thermostatic heater element maintains optimum temperature of enclosure 24/7 with minimal power usage.

##### Dataware
* Databank of recipes specify exact feed, light and temperature requirements for each plant, delivering perfect day/night cycles and rest periods.

### Audience
A triple stage business model initially targeting the consumer market, focusing on millennial families looking to improve their diets with minimal effort through the use of technology.

## Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

### Business Plan

#### Core business drivers

##### Strategy

<img src="/media/ruuts__model.svg" >

[//]: # (The first key business growth driver is strategy. Every fast-growing business starts with an idea, which turns into the business plan. The strategy might revolve around bringing a new product to market, or be based on an existing product or service applied or delivered in a new way. Accelerated growth can be driven by developing more new products, and/or expanding into new markets.)
PlantIO will initially serve the consumer market with advanced technology for a competitive price, backed by social. Following this, the B2B market will be targeted through custom installations before eventually being positioned to provide a viable solution on an industrial scale. The ultimate goal for Ruuts is to grow plants in space with their PlantIO technology.

##### The Ruuts Team & Operations

[//]: # (Alongside strategy, people and operations represent another key growth driver. Companies that grow fast often have a key individual driving them forward – the person with the initial vision, energy and determination to step out along the entrepreneurial road. However, growing a business fast relies on teamwork. Entrepreneurs need to draw around them a group of individuals who they can trust, who share the same dreams and apply the same values when trying to bring that dream alive. On the operations side, a growing business needs to develop an appropriate infrastructure and keep adjusting that infrastructure as the business grows. This involves IT systems, processes, even basic office space. If you are growing fast, will you have enough room for your expanded team in six months’ time? And as the business grows, new operational systems may need to be developed to maintain efficiency.)

Ruuts is powered by 3 founders all of whom are key individuals with unique skills.

I will focus on the digital side of the business, developing the software and social strategy.

Brett Bartlett will use his expertise in horticulture to develop optimum plant recipes to ensure a quality end product.

Ashley Banner will use his electrical engineering background to develop the hardware systems.

##### Funding
[//]: # (Clearly no business can grow fast without the right funding, and so capital is another key growth driver. Finding the right form of financial backing, and at the right time, is critical. That’s not to say that high growth can only be achieved with large amounts of funding, or that high funding levels will automatically result in fast growth.)

**Ruuts are looking for £250,000 of funding to take the product to market.**

This will cover salary for all 3 founders over the course of 15 months of product development, starting in January 2019 after creation of the MVP. It will also cover investment in an initial stock of 100 PlantIO units.

##### Transactions
[//]: # (Transactions are also important for driving growth. These could include alliances in the form of strong supplier relationships. In addition, as the business grows, mergers and acquisitions may offer the potential to achieve a step change in growth, or facilitate entry into a new geographical market or a complementary service area.)
**Several opportunities are available to increase conversions and sales.**

Potential relationships with established seed suppliers such as Mr. Fothergills can add a reputability to the business in its' early days.

The opportunity to create a charity serving global hunger can further strengthen out reputation.

##### Risk & Reporting
[//]: # (Last but not least among the five business growth drivers comes risk and reporting. As the business grows, so it is essential to establish controls to manage the inevitable risks that accompany rapid business development. The reporting element is also important for growing companies, both internally and externally. Management teams need to communicate clearly between themselves, to understand business performance and delivery against future targets. Similarly, the company needs to report effectively to external investors and other stakeholders to maintain their ongoing confidence and support.)

#### Key Performance Indicators

Goal | KPI | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target | Year 3 Target
---- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Mass adoption of consumer unit | Number of sales of the PlantIO system | 100 | 500 | 5000
Active, growing knowledge base & online community | Number of monthly active users (MAU) on forum | launch | 50 | 500
Integration into SMB market | Number of custom installs | 1 | 10 | 50

#### Differentiation compared to competitors
PlantIO is differentiating from the competition in two main areas:
 * Pricing model
 * Product offering

#### Market Behaviours

### Projections

### Product Strategy

[//]: # (This section of the plan identifies the key products you will launch in your cloud portfolio, along with any bundling plans, special promotions, or other attachment strategies that will help you sell the products—including upselling and cross-selling to both new and existing customers. Any specifics you can include about differentiators between your offerings and those of your competitors will help you build your sales messaging as you progress further into the launch.)

#### Key Products
* PlantIO base system
* Heirloom seedpacks
* PlantIO app

##### Bundling plans
##### Special Promotions / Attachment strategies
##### Up-sells & Cross-sells
##### Differentiation compared to competitors

### Channel Strategy

[//]: # (This is where you identify the primary channels that you’ll use—both to sell your products and to educate and support your customers—along with the resources, training, and incentives that will drive channel performance. In complex channel organizations, products and offers may differ from one channel to the next, playing on the unique advantages of specific channels, such as direct sales teams or online portals.)

### Marketing Strategy

[//]: # (This section summarizes the activities you’ll use to drive awareness and generate leads, both in your identified markets and within your existing customer base. In large organizations, the marketing strategy may also include activities for generating internal awareness. Such internally oriented activities are particularly important in situations where many groups will “touch” customers as they progress from purchase to activation to support.)

### Customer Experience

[//]: # (This section documents the anticipated customer journey—either at a high level or in detail. Starting with how customers first hear about a product, it progresses through their purchase, activation, renewal, and possible cancellation. Exploring this journey helps to identify any “fall-off” points that may reduce conversion rates, or drive churn, while also helping to ensure that you’ll have the right people and systems in place to support the new products.)

### Technical Requirements

[//]: # (This section documents the technical requirements needed to support the new products. These requirements, which may be affected by decisions made in the previous sections of the plan, may include branding your customer-facing portals, and integrating sales and provisioning systems with third-party resources you’ve employed. Parallels can help you identify the technical requirements needed to launch your products.)

### Evaluation

[//]: # (This is where you spell out and prioritize the factors you’ll use to measure your success—for example, reaching a certain volume of sales in specific channels, or reducing churn of an existing product by attaching a cloud service. Try to be as specific and detailed as possible in outlining your goals and evaluation tactics—it will keep your team aligned and help to optimize activities through your launch.)

### Timeline and Execution

[//]: # (Finally, your plan needs to identify the timeline for execution, including next steps, the critical path for decisions, key milestones, and plans for reviewing and fine-tuning the GTM plan. This last point should not be overlooked, as good GTM plans are not static, but evolve with the project. As your plans progress, you can add details to increase the plan’s accuracy.)

#### Phase 1: MVP creation
We are currently developing the minimum viable product; whilst I design and develop the PlantIO application, Ashley is sourcing the components required to build the initial system to for scenario testing, whilst Brett is conducting detailed research into plant growth to create the first of our recipes. We expect the MVP to be ready in 3 months time, for our very first internal alpha testing which itself will run for a 3 month period.

Software | Software simulation of the PlantIO PWA
Hardware | Software simulation of the PlantIO PWA
Knowledge | Software simulation of the PlantIO PWA

#### Phase 2: Initial alpha test

#### Phases 3-5: Product Development Sprints
Following this, we will commit a further 6 months to product development and finalise the physical design and initial consumer model. We will then repeat our 3 month alpha test, and follow it up with a second 3 month period of improvements.

> It is important for us to remain agile as a company, and we will be using the length of harvests (around 21-30 days) to line up our sprints.

#### Phase 6: Beta Test
This will then lead into the 3 month public beta test which, if successful, will allow for an initial product launch during the Autumn of 2020 in 21 months time.

#### Phase 7: Product Launch
The Ruuts Grow System is at an extremely early stage of development, and requires considerable time dedication to product development. The physical components must undergo safety checks along with long-term testing, and the complete financial side of the product is yet to be calculated. Should the system be deemed to expensive for phase 1, we may have to begin our product in phase 2.

There is also the question of maintenance; as with any machine with moving parts, users will need to perform basic periodic checks on their systems. This maintenance procedure will be designed into the system, perhaps using sensors to check that the user has inspected the required components and cleaned where necessary.

Period | Phase | End date
------ | ----- | --------
0-6 months | MVP creation | December 2018
6-9 months | initial alpha test | March 2019
9-15 months | product development | October 2018
15-18 months | second alpha test | January 2019
18-21 months | product development | April 2019
21-24 months | beta test | July 2019
24 months | product launch | October 2019
