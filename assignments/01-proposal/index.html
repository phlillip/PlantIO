          We took the opportunity to experience growing our own food as a family. It's been fun introducing the process to our 2 year old daughter who really enjoyed helping us start to grow our own food and has learnt about how food can be produced
          and what part nature plays in the process.

          The instructions with the kit we used were a bit vague and missed a few vital elements (such as water occasionally) but with a little bit of improvisation and nature finally taking its course, we managed to start to grow some aubergines,
          peppers and green beans.

          "It has also encouraged us to grow our own tomatoes which took about 4-5 weeks before we could use them in a home made lasagne and vegetarian pizza (the Tomatoes tasted noticeably stronger and fresher). It is taking a fair bit of time for
          the aubergines, peppers and greenbeans to grow and we will persist but perhaps a simpler solution to assist growing our own food would help make it easier for a family."

          We will certainly try some new methods in the future and are now all excited at the prospects of growing our own food, we are also happy it has caught the interest of our daughter and let us understand more about food as a family as we
          interact together.

          <p>[2] Approximate timeline of 6 months to MVP in December 2018, a 3 month alpha test, 6 months product development, another 3 month alpha test, 3 months product development, 3 months public beta test, and launch in Autumn 2020.</p>

            The instructions with the kit we used were abit vague and missed a few vital elements (such as water occasionally) but with a little bit of improvisation and nature finally taking its course, we managed to start to grow some aubergines,
            peppers and green beans.

            It has also encouraged us to grow our own tomatoes which took about 4-5 weeks before we could use them in a home made lasagne and vegetarian pizza (the Tomatoes tasted noticeably stronger and fresher). It is taking a fair bit of time for
            the aubergines, peppers and greenbeans to grow and we will persist but perhaps a simpler solution to assist growing our own food would help make it easier for a family.

            We will certainly try some new methods in the future and are now all excited at the prospects of growing our own food, we are also happy it has caught the interest of our daughter and let us understand more about food as a family as we
