Problem / Opportunity
=====================
A slide that defines what the problem is that you are attempting to solve
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We are eating raspberries from Chile.
If we want to eat a raspberry in November, we have to import it from halfway across the world, at massive cost to the planet, the quality of the fruit, and with little control over it's origins; we don't know it's history or how 'organic' it really is.
APP
We provide multiple reasons we do not grow our own food, whether we blame climate, our schedules, our free space, or our ability. But the fact is that food is one of the 3 key elements all humans need to survive, along with warmth and shelter.

Value Proposition
=================
A slide that outlines what your solution is
-------------------------------------------
## Grow perfect food anywhere, anytime, super fast, from a trustworthy source.
# Automatically.
Using our system, we can grow perfect food, whenever we want, wherever we want, really fast, using trustworthy seeds, saving water, saving land, saving the planet, all automatically. We can grow enough food to feed our family, with virtually no time cost. We can teach our family how to grow food and care for plants using optional manual or semi-automatic recipes. We can create our own recipes and share them with the world. We can even compete to grow the biggest tomato, the brightest, the tastiest or the fastest.

Underlying Magic

#Complete control
## Aeroponics  |  LED  |  Recipes
APP
Our system provides complete control of plant growth. Watering and feeding, light exposure, and temperature are all delivered to exact specifications based on your starting seed. Using our 'recipes' we do all the hard work for you - simply place the seeds in for germination, select the superior sproutling when instructed and then pick the fruits when instructed. The PlantIO app monitors all aspects of the plants' health and adjusts the system as required, only sending you notifications in emergency situations. This fully automated growing can be adjusted to give you back some control; we know a lot of you take pleasure from the pure act of growing. We accommodate this by providing two extra kinds of recipes to live alongside the fully automatic variety. 'Semi-automatic' recipes notify you when it's time to feed, water or give light to your plant. You must then use the app to to control the grow system yourself. Finally, we have 'manual' recipes which provide no instructions whatsoever; it is up to you to decide how and when to care for your plant. All data is recorded so you can any recipes which work particularly well and share them  with the Ruuts community.

Business Model
==============
A slide that defines your business model, so how will the revenue come into the business and what does it need to be spent on
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verticals: consumer | business | industry
Focus on consumer: families, new generation
## 1/4: Millenials.
Help save your planet.

## 2/4: Generation Z children.

Through our staggered launch model, we will initially be targeting consumers allowing them to buy in at a very low level, then upgrade as the system forms part of their daily life.

[//]: # (Millenials)

Society has become aware; aware of the environment, aware of what we eat, and aware of our impression on others. Millenials, in particular, see the popularity behind lifestyle choices and provide an opportunity for marketing purposes for our product.

In particular we are focusing on the "Millenials".

[//]: # (Generation Z)

We will also be targeting the youth of "Generation Z". This market segment provides a huge opportunity for free marketing - the Instagram generation are all too eager to show off their exploits to their followers, particularly when it comes to health and their bodies. What can be healthier than the purest, sustainable food possible?

## Staggered launch.
## Modular design.
## Community building.
Our staggered launch provides the opportunity to give focus to different market segments while still serving all of them as our facilities develop.

Initially targeting the consumer, we aim to infiltrate habits with our base system - this allows for
The modular design allows for limitless expansion and upgrading, whilst the sharing of recipes will build a social community and a huge knowledge base.

As we develop our offering we will shift our focus directly to businesses in the catering community, providing small-scale tailored installs for individual restaurants, chains, and farm shops. This will culminate in the creation of bolt-on farms for supermarkets.

Beyond this we are investigating the applications of third world salvation and Aeroponics in extreme climates, such as the poles and space.

Competitive Analysis
====================
A slide that outlines your competitors
--------------------------------------
There is a huge gap in the market; small hobbyist programs such as PlantFriends or FlowerCare cost very little, but are not suited for substantial food growth.

FarmBot, our nearest competitor offers an entry level option of over £1000, yet still requires outdoor growing space and uses dated farming methods.

AeroFarms are huge and serve the industry with prices starting from tens of thousands of dollars. There is an opportunity for low cost, low management convenient home growing using advanced techniques.
